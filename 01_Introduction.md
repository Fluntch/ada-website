# Introduction

In an age of rapid information consumption, understanding how specific article
characteristics influence navigation behavior in Wikispeedia could offer insights into
decision-making within hyperlinked environments. We hypothesize that player success in
reaching target articles in Wikispeedia may be impacted by inherent article attributes, such as
length, link density, and topic specificity. Our project seeks to analyze how these attributes
correlate with path success. First, metrics are established for quantifying article “goodness”.
This is achieved both using a theoretical and player-centered approach, resulting in article
rankings. Subsequently, we aim to investigate what article characteristics influence player
success, through the establishment of statistically significant positive correlation to good
articles. These characteristics are then converted into attributes that serve as inputs for
supervised machine learning models, where the target variable is goodness, revealing patterns
that could enrich our understanding of strategic decision-making within web-based
information pathways.


# Research Questions

This project aims to address the following research questions:

- How can one determine what constitutes a "good" article in Wikispeedia?
- Are the articles that players tend to flock to in the game "good" from the perspective of graph theory?
- What attributes make an article a driver for efficient path completion in Wikispeedia?
